        <p><em>Career Coach and <strong>Aspiring Web Developer</strong></em></p>
        <p>
          I'm a strong community and social services professional with diverse experience
          in customer management, social media marketing, financial operations,
          case management, and career coaching.
          I currently help individuals figure out their interests, passions, and skills,
          while working as a partner and mentor to see how to incorporate their
          personalities into their careers! I assist with interest assessments,
          informational interviews, employer engagement, resume development,
          interview preparation, and all things in-between, until the individual has
          landed a dream job, or feels confident enough to continue without additional
          guidance.
          Continuous learner, espeically in the IT field, including web design and
          development.
